# moderndev-multi-page-website

Project Assignment 1 will be the glue that binds together all other project assignments for this chapter.4

You will create a website consisting of multiple web pages. We list this project assignment first because it brings together all of the other assignments in this chapter, but you may want to work on it last, when you have completed the other components. Below are the guidelines for creating the web pages:

1. A Homepage that contains:
    - A menu with links to every other page  
    - A large background image behind a large heading containing your name, your career path, and a quote that you find inspiring.  

2. A page each that showcases Project Assignment 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Each page should also contain a link back to the homepage.  


3. A page that links to each form you will create for project assignment 4
